Vehicle Emission Category Prediction
This project uses Logistic Regression to classify vehicles into emission categories based on their attributes. The goal is to support environmental monitoring and vehicle regulation using machine learning.

📌 Features
Data preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling)
Categorical and numerical feature handling
Logistic Regression model training and evaluation
Visualization of performance (confusion matrix)
Sample prediction using trained model

📂 Dataset
The dataset (vehicle_emissions.csv) contains various vehicle features and corresponding emission categories.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Seaborn, Matplotlib

📈 Output
The model provides:
A classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
A confusion matrix plot
Emission prediction for a sample vehicle
